					Bryce Jeremiah Cokesniffer IV was born on February 29th, 1984, in Sheridan, Wyoming. He graduated from MIT (Mississippi Institute of Technology) in 2006, at the age of 5. He worked in customer service at Papa John's Pizza, making $265,000 a month. Unfortunately, he was unjustly fired after 2 years, when it was discovered that he had eaten the entire monthly stock of pizza dough from the warehouse. In a fit of despair, he ate two mushrooms that were growing in his kitchen, and had an extremely violent seizure after snorting asbestos. This was where he got the inspiration to found BuyMyBowls, a site dedicated to being the ultimate bowl shopping destination. He served as CEO for four years, until December 21st, 2012, when he traggically he passed away after a terrible bowl eating accident, at the age of 7. His legacy lives on eternally through us. We have taken his original bowl design manuscripts, thrown them away, and produced actually good* bowls.
