					BuyMyBowls was founded on the 30th of September, 2008, by Bryce J. Cokesniffer. The revolutionary idea came to him while in an amazing hallucinogenic trip after eating some mushrooms he found growing behind his dishwasher. The story goes, he hallucinated that he was trying to eat some Fritos, but the bag kept ripping and showering his pants with chip powder. At that moment, he reported that all he wished for was a bowl to put the chips in, while screaming "BOWLS! WHERE ARE ALL MY GODDAMN BOWLS?!". After miraculously surviving a seizure after attepting to snort the chip powder, which turned out to be sawdust laced with asbestos that had been leaking from his ceiling, he decided to create BuyMyBowls, the world's first and only company that is fully dedicated to improving the experience for bowl shoppers the world over.
